/*
 * Read-only survey of the pushbuffer a title submits.
 *
 * The title builds NV2A commands in guest RAM and advances DMA_PUT; nothing
 * here executes them, so the framebuffer stays black however far the game
 * gets. Before any of that can be made to draw, the question is what it
 * actually asks for -- which methods, on which object classes, how many of
 * them -- because that is the difference between "the existing PGRAPH
 * translator nearly covers this" and "this needs a real one".
 *
 * Purely a reader: it walks the buffer and counts, and never writes to guest
 * memory or to the GPU state. Enabled with RECOMP_PB_SCAN.
 *
 * Pushbuffer encoding (NV20/NV2A), one dword per command header:
 *   (w & 0xE0030003) == 0x00000000  increasing methods
 *   (w & 0xE0030003) == 0x40000000  non-increasing (same method, count params)
 *   (w & 0x00000003) == 0x00000001  jump
 *   (w & 0x00000003) == 0x00000002  call
 *   (w & 0xFFFF0003) == 0x00020000  return
 * For a method header: count = (w >> 18) & 0x7FF, subchannel = (w >> 13) & 7,
 * method = w & 0x1FFC.
